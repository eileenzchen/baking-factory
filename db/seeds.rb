# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# User.destroy_all # clobber everything in DB first
# Customer.destroy_all
# mark_user = User.create(username: "mark", password: "secret", password_confirmation: "secret", role: "admin")

# mark = Customer.create(first_name: "Mark", last_name: "Heimann", email: "mark@thebakingfactory.com", phone: "412-268-2323", user_id: mark_user.id, active: true)
